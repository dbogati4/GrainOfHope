,"—=Data are not available or not presented. Some countries did not exist in their present borders in the given year or reference period.
Note: As always, rankings and index scores from this table cannot be accurately compared to rankings and index scores from previous reports (see Appendix A).
For the 2024 GHI report, data were assessed for 136 countries. Out of these, there were sufficient data to calculate 2024 GHI scores for and rank 127 countries (by way of comparison, 125 countries were ranked in the 2023 report).
* For 9 countries, individual scores could not be calculated and ranks could not be
determined owing to lack of data. Where possible, these countries were provisionally
designated by severity: 1 as serious and 2 as alarming. For 6 countries, provisional designations could not be established (see Table A.3 in Appendix A). 
1 Ranked according to 2024 GHI scores. Countries that have identical 2024 scores are  given the same ranking (for example, Armenia and Bulgaria are both ranked 23th).
2 The 22 countries with 2024 GHI scores of less than 5 are not assigned individual ranks, but rather are collectively ranked 1-22. Differences between their scores are minimal.
